        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Tarator is a traditional cold soup originating from the Balkan
            region, popular in countries like Bulgaria, Greece, Macedonia, and
            Turkey. This refreshing dish is ideal for warm weather, combining
            yogurt, cucumbers, garlic, and herbs such as dill and mint. Some
            variations include walnuts for added texture. The soup is seasoned
            with salt and sometimes vinegar or lemon juice, and it's served
            chilled. Known for its cooling and hydrating properties, tarator
            offers a delightful blend of tangy yogurt, crisp cucumbers, and
            aromatic herbs, making it a nutritious and popular choice in hot
            climates.
